# Git-Emoji Dataset 📑

This repository contains emoji data and contextual keywords associated with them. It is meant to be used, **by everyone**, who needs a reference dataset of emojis applicable in git commit messages.

Dataset is structured as importable JS-files, under the `data` subdirectory. Note that the `main` branch may get updated at any time without notice.
